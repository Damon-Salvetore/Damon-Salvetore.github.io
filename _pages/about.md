## Damp Group
I am honored to have co-organized a collaborative research group spanning multiple universities (including SCUT, HKUST(GZ), et al.), focusing on Accelerating LLM Inferrence, Software/Hardware Co-design, and Quantization for LLM. I want to extend my deepest appreciation to all the members of the Damp Group and our collaborators for their tireless efforts. As our projects have progressed, we have ensured that credit has been rightfully and transparently acknowledged in our papers, with the invaluable guidance and support of our supervisors.

The details of the projects and collaborations are as follows (Only first/co-first author and corresponding author):

**[DAC'25]** Research on **algorithm-hardware co-design for LLM** circuit design and its design automation, conducted by Yingbo Hao (HKUST) and Huangxu Chen (HKUST(GZ)).

**[ICCS'24]** Research on **in-memory-computing**, conducted by Yingbo Hao (SCUT) and Huangxu Chen (HKUST(GZ)).
